Hi,
I am Akshat. By occupation, I'm a control engineering but deep down, I would love to think of myself as Mathematician. I also like to believe that programming puts life 
into maths and thus also love to do scientific and algorithmic coding. Some of my projects are in the repository ranging from building a 3D printer from scratch, modelling of cyber-physical system,
control of aircraft using MPC and designing a automatic trade log system for a trading firm. 
For any kind of question regarding the projects, please contact me at akshat_1995@yahoo.co.in
